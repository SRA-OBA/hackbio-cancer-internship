**Uncovering Molecular Biomarkers in Human Cancer with COSMIC**

**Introduction**

Given the remarkable number of human cancer diseases (about 2500), there was an apparent need to classify and curate the mutations and cancer genomic data. In this way, there would be an excellent annotation to human genome annotations to identify events associated with cancer development (Forbes _et al.,_ 2014). This need led to the development of COSMIC (available at: https\://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic), a web server containing comprehensive resources to explore somatic mutations in human cancer.

**Features and Applications of COSMIC**

As shown in Fig.1, data on the scientific database are sourced from scientific publications and large-scale systematic screenings, which expert curators then check. These sets of data are then extracted and structured into categories, including Cancer Gene Census curation, Core Variant curation, and Actionability curation. Furthermore, the curated data are then annotated, with proper standardization, on other scientific servers such as ENSEMBLE, Protein Databank, and HUGO.

Cancer biologists benefit greatly from using COSMIC because it enables them to analyze large databases using computational analyses. These include COSMIC 3-D, Cancer Mutation Census, and Mutational Signatures. With COSMIC 3-D, researchers are able to integrate cancer mutations with protein structures across the human genome to understand how the mutations impact protein function, stability, and interaction (Alsulami _et al.,_ 2021). Meanwhile, the Cancer Mutation census serves as a catalog of genetic variants that contribute to cancer development. The catalog covers both rare and common mutations, which can be very useful in designing targeted therapies for different cancers (Cosmic, 2019). Researchers with an interest in characterizing patterns of DNA mutations across various cancers will find mutational signatures very useful on COSMIC. This tool enables users to gain insights into the underlying causes of mutations. These could be environmental factors, potential carcinogens, or pathways associated with carcinogenesis (Alexandrov _et al.,_ 2020). Other beneficial resources are Actionability, which indicates the available drugs for specific mutations in cancer, and Drug Resistance, focusing on the curation of mutations that enable cancerous cells to be resistant to existing treatments (Cosmic, 2019).

**Conclusion**

Undoubtedly, COSMIC is a dynamic server with multipurpose values in the field of biomarker discovery. Exploring and mastering the database will play a key role in elucidating cancer biology and optimizing therapeutic interventions for cancer treatments.
